          <header>About Me</header>
          I didn't take the typical path to becoming a software developer. As a
          kid I was always curious about how things were built and was good at
          math and science. I even 'dissected' an old computer in my bedroom,
          but in reality it was more of a demolition. After high school, I went
          to an engineering focused college in hopes of being a Civil Engineer,
          but quickly found it didn't interest me. I changed my focus to
          business because I've always liked math and my new department required
          me to take an Information Systems class. There I found my passion for
          computers and how they work. My first programming language was Java
          and I loved tinkering around and making little terminal applications.
          My Java skills grew further at my first two jobs, but my love for
          stopped. In my own time I tought myself JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
          building small sites and single-purpose applications. From there I
          learned React and TypeScript and that helped me land to my current job
          at Coolfire Solutions. Today, I enjoy the work that I do for Coolfire
          and am still learning new things outside of work.

          <ul>
            <li>
              There are many workout tracking and fitness applications on the
              market, but I wanted one that I could call my own.
            </li>
            <li>
              Building my own workout tracker also gave me an excuse to learn
              React Native and GraphQL.
            </li>
            <li>
              I decided to build my own Apollo backend for this project as well
              as a frontend using Expo.
            </li>
            <li>
              The application is simple, but it allows me to digitally track my
              progress instead of on paper.

              I wanted/needed a personal website to act as my portfolio and I
              figured it was the perfect opportunity to make my own without a
              website builder's help.
            </li>
            <li>
              This site is built with HTML and CSS compiled from Sass. I'm not
              quite a CSS guru, so I chose to learn a pre-processor during this
              project.

              A custom web application built for a local waterproofing company
              to track project performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              The app estimates bid prices based on labor, material, and
              equipment cost inputs from the user. It also tracks the
              profitability of one or more jobs over any given range.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is built on a version of the MEAN stack: MySQL, ExpressJS,
              Angular 4, Node.js.
            </li>
            <li>An on-premises Ubuntu server hosts the entire application.</li>

              One of my main roles was to write and maintain Jenkins deployment
