    <AboutContent header='About Me'>
      I didn't take the typical path to becoming a software developer. As a kid I was always curious about how things
      were built and was good at math and science. I even 'dissected' an old computer in my bedroom, but in reality it
      was more of a demolition. After high school, I went to an engineering focused college in hopes of being a Civil
      Engineer, but quickly found it didn't interest me. I changed my focus to business because I've always liked math
      and my new department required me to take an Information Systems class. There I found my passion for computers and
      how they work. My first programming language was Java and I loved tinkering around and making little terminal
      applications. My Java skills grew further at my first two jobs, but my love for stopped. In my own time I tought
      myself JavaScript, HTML, and CSS building small sites and single-purpose applications. From there I learned React
      and TypeScript and that helped me land to my current job at Coolfire Solutions. Today, I enjoy the work that I do
      for Coolfire and am still learning new things outside of work.
